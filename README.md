# AoC2015
Solutions to the Advent of Code challenge 2015 in Go

NOTE: I stopped working on these around problem 21 because I have a short attention span. I've started doing
Project Euler since then and whilst I won't publish solutions to Euler problems (as that would deny others the 
experience of solving them for themselves) I have been putting together a utility library of functions that 
I've used in my solutions that may be of use to others.
